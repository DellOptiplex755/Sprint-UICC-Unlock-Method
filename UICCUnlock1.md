# 🔓 Attempting UICC Unlock (1/2):

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> This is where I'm very unsure of how it works, so if UICC Unlock fails for you,<br/>
> or UICC Unlock doesn't show up, you may be unable to get your device unlocked.

> [!NOTE]
> You may be able to use T-Mobile's network pass to get an active eSIM to unlock<br/>
> However this requires having a Sim inserted from a T-Mobile MVNO.<br/>
> There may be an update in the future showing how to achieve this..

<div align="center"> 

> **❗❗ Make sure your ***Model Name*** ends in *"U1"* in settings! ❗❗**

⭐ Insert your T-Mobile (or T-Mobile MVNO) Sim Card to make sure it gets service OR at least shows in <br/> ***Settings > Connections > SIM Manager***
> 💡 You may be prompted to restart your phone! 💡

⭐ After confirming that your Sim can be read and displayed, go to ***Settings > Software Update*** <br/>
and make sure that ***UICC Unlock*** is displayed.
> 💡 If you have an active Sim Card, make a test call, or browse the internet to make sure service is working before continuing. 💡 <br/>
> ⚠️ If you do NOT have an active Sim Card, connect to Wifi before continuing if you haven't already. ⚠️

⭐ After ensuring ***UICC Unlock*** is showing in Software Update you can now move on to flashing firmware again.
