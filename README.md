## Enter Download Mode:
### Most "newer" Samsung devices without a Bixby button enter Download Mode like this:
### 1. Plug your phone into your PC then turn your phone off
### 2. Wait for your phone to fully turn off and then hold Vol up + Vol down
### 3. When the warning screen pops up, press the Vol up button
### 4. If it worked you should see your device pop up in ODIN as "0:[COM#]"
### If you are trying this on an older device, look up a guide on how to enter Download Mode on YOUR device.
### If for some reason ODIN does not detect your device in Download Mode, make sure you installed the Samsung USB Drivers!

‚ùó‚ùó **YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT THE USERDATA FILE IN IT'S RESPECTIVE SLOT** ‚ùó‚ùó

‚≠ê Once you have every file in place, click **Start**, and your device should begin to flash<br/>

‚≠ê If everything went well, you should see PASS in ODIN, and your device should reboot!

> [!WARNING]
> This is where I'm very unsure of how it works, so if UICC Unlock fails for you,<br/>
> or UICC Unlock doesn't show up, you may be unable to get your device unlocked.

> [!NOTE]
> You may be able to use T-Mobile's network pass to get an active eSIM to unlock<br/>
> However this requires having a Sim inserted from a T-Mobile MVNO.<br/>
> There may be an update in the future showing how to achieve this..

<div align="center"> 

> **‚ùó‚ùó Make sure your ***Model Name*** ends in *"U1"* in settings! ‚ùó‚ùó**

‚≠ê Insert your T-Mobile (or T-Mobile MVNO) Sim Card to make sure it gets service OR at least shows in <br/> ***Settings > Connections > SIM Manager***
> üí° You may be prompted to restart your phone! üí°

‚≠ê After confirming that your Sim can be read and displayed, go to ***Settings > Software Update*** <br/>
and make sure that ***UICC Unlock*** is displayed.
> üí° If you have an active Sim Card, make a test call, or browse the internet to make sure service is working before continuing. üí° <br/>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you do NOT have an active Sim Card, connect to Wifi before continuing if you haven't already. ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚≠ê After ensuring ***UICC Unlock*** is showing in Software Update you can now move on to flashing firmware again.

> üí° Booting should take a bit longer than usual, do not panic! üí°<br/>
> üí° Your phone may show a Sprint or T-Mobile boot logo this time, this is good! üí°

‚≠ê Once you are fully booted back into android, make sure you're connected to Mobile Data. (or Wifi if you dont have an active Sim)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not be alarmed if random apps have appeared or start to download, this is Carrier Bloat and (*Unfortunately*) normal! ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚≠ê Let your phone settle for a little bit (approx. 5-10min), and then head to ***Settings > Software Update***<br/>
‚≠ê Tap on ***UICC Unlock***, you should hopefully get a popup like this:

‚≠ê If everything went smoothly.... CONGRATULATIONS!!!! YOU DID IT!!!!! You should recieve a popup like this:

### Apologies if this is a bit confusing and not the best looking, this is my first time doing a "write up" on something so... complex lmfao

### I'll be trying to get more Sprint locked devices to iron our any issues, or if I missed a step, but this is exactly how I got my S20+ unlocked.

### Thank you so much for reading, and I hope it worked for you!!!!
