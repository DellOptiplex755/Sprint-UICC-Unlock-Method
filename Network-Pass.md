# Getting Network Pass

This is super easy, the only requirement is that you have a sim card from one of T-Mobile's MNVOs... such as Google Fi, Helium, Lyca, Mint (METRO WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK!)

Download the T-Life app from the google play store

Accept all permissions and Tap "Explore App"

under the home tab you should see a trial option

go through the trial setup, and download your esim

once your esim is downloaded you should have service, and can attempt the UICC unlock

YOU MAY HAVE TO FOLLOW T-MOBILE'S UNLOCK POLICIES FOR UICC UNLOCK TO WORK!!!!
