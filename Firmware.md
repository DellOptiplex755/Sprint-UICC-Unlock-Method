# ⤵️ Downloading Firmware:
 
⭐ Get the ***Model Name*** and  ***Serial Number*** of your device, under ***Settings > About Phone*** ⭐

⭐ Once you have your ***Model Name*** and ***Serial Number***, open Bifrost and type them in, along with the Reigon code of ***"SPR"*** ⭐

> 💡 *`It should look like this!`* 💡

<br/> ⭐ Next, click the *"Check for updates"* button on the top left, and then the *"Download"* button. ⭐

<br/>

> ❗❗ **`Bifrost will prompt you to save the firmware in a folder, make sure you put it somewhere you'll remember`** ❗❗<br/>⚠️ **`This also may take some time to download`** ⚠️

<br/>

⭐ When your download completes, go **BACK** into Bifrost and at the end of the ***Model Name***, add "*U1*" ⭐

> 💡 `OR just` "*U*" `if your model ended in` "*U1*" `in the previous step!` 💡

<br/>

⭐ After both files are downloaded, you should have one with *"U1"* AND one with *"U"* in the filename ⭐

> 💡 *`Just like this!`* 💡
