## Enter Download Mode:
### Most "newer" Samsung devices without a Bixby button enter Download Mode like this:
### 1. Plug your phone into your PC then turn your phone off
### 2. Wait for your phone to fully turn off and then hold Vol up + Vol down
### 3. When the warning screen pops up, press the Vol up button
### 4. If it worked you should see your device pop up in ODIN as "0:[COM#]"
### If you are trying this on an older device, look up a guide on how to enter Download Mode on YOUR device.
### If for some reason ODIN does not detect your device in Download Mode, make sure you installed the Samsung USB Drivers!

❗❗ **YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT THE USERDATA FILE IN IT'S RESPECTIVE SLOT** ❗❗

⭐ Once you have every file in place, click **Start**, and your device should begin to flash<br/>

⭐ If everything went well, you should see PASS in ODIN, and your device should reboot!

> ❗❗ **IF THE FLASH FAILS, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE.. DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU DOWNLOADED REGION CODE "SPR"** ❗❗
