# 🔓 Attempting UICC Unlock (2/2):

> 💡 Booting should take a bit longer than usual, do not panic! 💡<br/>
> 💡 Your phone may show a Sprint or T-Mobile boot logo this time, this is good! 💡

⭐ Once you are fully booted back into android, make sure you're connected to Mobile Data. (or Wifi if you dont have an active Sim)

> ⚠️ Do not be alarmed if random apps have appeared or start to download, this is Carrier Bloat and (*Unfortunately*) normal! ⚠️

⭐ Let your phone settle for a little bit (approx. 5-10min), and then head to ***Settings > Software Update***<br/>
⭐ Tap on ***UICC Unlock***, you should hopefully get a popup like this:

> ⚠️ If the ***UICC Unlock*** popup, opens and instantly closes, wait a bit longer or check your connection.⚠️

⭐ If everything went smoothly.... CONGRATULATIONS!!!! YOU DID IT!!!!! You should recieve a popup like this:

### Apologies if this is a bit confusing and not the best looking, this is my first time doing a "write up" on something so... complex lmfao

### I'll be trying to get more Sprint locked devices to iron our any issues, or if I missed a step, but this is exactly how I got my S20+ unlocked.

### Thank you so much for reading, and I hope it worked for you!!!!
